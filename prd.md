# Product Requirements Document: Devitter

## Project Information
**Project Name:** Devitter
**Date:** 2025-03-24
**Author:** Emma, Product Manager

## Original Requirements
Create a project similar to Twitter but focused on internal work tracking and information sharing for a software development company. The platform should have a timeline where team members can share updates about what they're working on, challenges/blockers they're facing, and ideas. The main goal is to prevent complexity often found in tools like Jira or Notion, which can be difficult to keep organized.

## 1. Product Definition

### 1.1 Product Vision
Devitter is an internal communication platform designed specifically for software development teams that prioritizes simplicity and effectiveness, enabling transparent work tracking and knowledge sharing without the overhead of complex project management systems.

### 1.2 Product Goals
1. **Simplify Internal Communication**: Create a streamlined platform that requires minimal training and setup while effectively facilitating team information sharing.
2. **Increase Work Visibility**: Enable team members to easily share and track progress, challenges, and ideas across the organization in a chronological timeline.
3. **Enhance Team Collaboration**: Foster a culture of knowledge sharing and problem-solving through accessible communication channels without the complexity of traditional project management tools.
4. **Boost Productivity**: Reduce time spent on status meetings and create a single source of truth for team updates.
5. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Surface patterns in work progress and blockers to help teams identify process improvements.

### 1.3 User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to quickly post updates about my current tasks so that my team knows what I'm working on without scheduling additional meetings.
2. **As a team lead**, I want to see a timeline of all team activities and blockers so that I can identify issues early and provide necessary support.
3. **As a product manager**, I want to share product updates and gather feedback from the development team so that we can iterate effectively.
4. **As a new team member**, I want to browse through past updates and discussions so that I can get up to speed with ongoing projects and team dynamics.
5. **As an engineering manager**, I want to identify recurring challenges across teams so that we can implement systemic solutions to common problems.
6. **As a developer**, I want automated status updates from my Git commits and PRs so I don't have to manually post routine updates.
7. **As a team member**, I want to quickly find relevant past discussions about specific features or issues without digging through multiple tools.
8. **As a remote worker**, I want to stay connected with team progress and challenges without overwhelming message notifications.

### 2.4 Open Questions

1. **Integration Depth**: How deeply should we integrate with development tools like GitHub, Jira, etc.? Should we focus on a few key integrations first or try to be comprehensive?

2. **Archiving Policy**: Should old posts automatically archive after a certain time period? How do we balance keeping a clean feed with preserving institutional knowledge?

3. **Private vs. Public**: Should we allow private messages or posts visible only to specific teams, or keep everything transparent across the organization?

4. **Metrics**: What metrics should we track to measure the success of the platform? User engagement, information discovery efficiency, reduction in meetings?

5. **User Onboarding**: What is the minimum viable onboarding process for new users to start contributing effectively?

6. **Mobile Strategy**: Should we prioritize a responsive web design or develop native mobile apps?

7. **Notification Balancing**: How do we ensure users get important notifications without causing notification fatigue?

8. **AI Integration**: How much should we leverage AI for generating insights and summaries without adding complexity?

9. **Sprint Integration**: Should we integrate with sprint cycles to provide context to posts and updates?
