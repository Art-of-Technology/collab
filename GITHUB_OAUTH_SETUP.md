# GitHub OAuth Integration Setup

This guide will help you set up GitHub OAuth integration for seamless repository connection in your Collab project.

## üöÄ **What You Get**

- **One-click repository connection** (no more manual repo ID hunting!)
- **Automatic webhook setup** (no more GitHub settings navigation!)
- **Repository browser** with search and filtering
- **Permission validation** (ensures you can actually connect the repo)
- **Visual status indicators** (see which repos are already connected)

## üìã **Prerequisites**

1. A GitHub account with access to repositories you want to connect
2. Admin access to repositories (required for webhook creation)
3. Your Collab application deployed and accessible

## üîß **Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Create a GitHub OAuth App**

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click **"New OAuth App"**
3. Fill in the details:
   ```
   Application name: Collab Integration
   Homepage URL: https://your-collab-domain.com
   Application description: Project management integration with GitHub
   Authorization callback URL: https://your-collab-domain.com/api/github/oauth/callback
   ```
4. Click **"Register application"**
5. Copy the **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**

### **Step 2: Configure Environment Variables**

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# GitHub OAuth Configuration
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id_here
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret_here

# Make sure NEXTAUTH_URL is set correctly
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-collab-domain.com
```

### **Step 3: Deploy and Test**

1. Deploy your application with the new environment variables
2. Go to any project settings page
3. Navigate to the "GitHub Integration" section
4. Click **"Connect with GitHub"**
5. Authorize the application
6. Select a repository from the list
7. Click **"Connect"** - webhook will be created automatically!

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **OAuth Flow**
```
User clicks "Connect with GitHub"
    ‚Üì
Opens GitHub OAuth popup
    ‚Üì
User authorizes application
    ‚Üì
GitHub redirects to callback
    ‚Üì
Store access token in database
    ‚Üì
Fetch user's repositories
    ‚Üì
Display repository selector
```

### **Repository Connection**
```
User selects repository
    ‚Üì
Validate user has admin access
    ‚Üì
Create webhook in GitHub repo
    ‚Üì
Store repository connection in database
    ‚Üì
Initialize default version (0.0.0)
    ‚Üì
Ready for version tracking!
```

## üîí **Security Considerations**

1. **Access Tokens**: Currently stored in plain text. In production, encrypt them using a service like AWS KMS or similar.

2. **Webhook Secrets**: Generated randomly and used to verify webhook authenticity.

3. **Permissions**: Only users with admin access to repositories can connect them.

4. **Scopes**: The OAuth app requests these permissions:
   - `repo`: Full repository access (needed for webhooks)
   - `read:user`: Read user profile
   - `user:email`: Read user email
   - `admin:repo_hook`: Manage webhooks

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **"GitHub account not connected" Error**
- User needs to complete OAuth flow first
- Check if `githubAccessToken` is stored in user record

### **"You need admin access" Error**
- User must have admin permissions on the repository
- Repository owner needs to grant admin access

### **"Hook already exists" Error**
- Webhook URL already configured for this repository
- Check GitHub repository webhook settings
- Delete existing webhook and try again

### **"Repository not found" Error**
- Repository might be private and user doesn't have access
- Check repository name and owner are correct
- Verify OAuth token has correct permissions

## üé® **UI Features**

### **Repository Browser**
- **Search**: Find repositories by name or description
- **Filters**: Show only accessible repositories
- **Status Indicators**: See which repos are already connected
- **Permission Badges**: Visual indication of access level
- **Metadata**: Stars, language, last updated, default branch

### **Connection Status**
- **Connected**: Green checkmark with project name
- **No Access**: Gray indicator with explanation
- **Available**: Blue "Connect" button

### **Fallback Options**
- Manual setup option (currently disabled)
- Clear error messages with actionable advice
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

## üìà **What's Next**

After connecting repositories, users can:
- View GitHub integration status in issue detail pages
- See pull requests, commits, and CI/CD checks
- Track version progression across environments
- Access AI-enhanced changelogs
- Monitor deployment status

## üîÑ **Migration from Manual Setup**

If you have repositories connected via the old manual method:
1. They will continue to work normally
2. Webhooks are already configured
3. No migration needed
4. New connections will use OAuth flow
